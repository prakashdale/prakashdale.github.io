- **What are directives in Angular?**
    
    A class that can modify structure of the DOM or modify attributes in the DOM and component data model. A directive class definition is immidiately preceeded by @Directive() decorator that supplies metadata.

    A directive class is usually associated with an HTML element or attribute, and that element or attribute is often referred to as the directive itself. When angular finds a directive in HTML template, it creates the matching class instance and gives the instance control over that portion of the browser DOM.

    There are thre categories of directive:
    - **Components** use @Component() (an extension of @Directive()) to associate a template with a class.
    - **Attribute** directives modify behaviour and appearance of page element.
    - **Structural Directives** modify the structure of the DOM.

    Angular supplies a number of built-in directives that begin with the ng-prefix. You can also create new directives to implement your own functionality.

**How to create new Angular project in docker dev environment?**

Prerequisite

- Docker should be running with WSL2 enabled.
- *Remote Containers* VS Code extension is installed.

Create new folder for the project.

Add new subfolder `app`

Closed folder from 'File' menu and open folder *<project folder>/app* to make *app* as root folder in VS Code

Add new folder `.devcontainer` in the *app* folder.

Add new file `devcontainer.json` in the *.devcontainer* folder with following code.

```json
{
    "name": "GreenwoodsWeb",
    "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
    "forwardPorts": [4200],
    "runArgs": ["-u", "node"],
    "settings": {
        "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
    },
    "postCreateCommand": "npm install",
    "extensions": [
        "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
        "johnpapa.angular-essentials",
        "coenraads.bracket-pair-colorizer",
        "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
        "ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin",
        "angular.ng-template"
    ]

}
```

Create new `Dockerfile` in the *.devcontainer* folder as below

```
FROM node:latest
RUN npm install -g @angular/cli
RUN npm install -g prettier
```

Click on *Open Removte Window* button available at the bottom-left corner of the VS Code. Then select *Remote Containers: Reopen in Container* from command pallette.

Please wait while new container is being created. 

Now you have a new development environment in docker with latest angular and node version.

Open a new terminal and run command *ng new <app name>* e.g. *ng new community* where *community* is the web-app name.

A new project will be create in the docker volume mapped to current folder. 

Go to app folder. `cd community` and run below command to add enable angular material theme.

`ng add @angular/material`

The ng add command will additionally perform the following configurations:

- Add project dependencies to package.json
- Add the Roboto font to your index.html
- Add the Material Design icon font to your index.html
- Add a few global CSS styles to:
    - Remove margins from body
    - Set height: 100% on html and body
    - Set Roboto as the default application font

Run *ng serve* in termnal window and then go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to confirm that environment is set correctly.

Open *commnunity/src/app/app.component.html* and delete everything except `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`

*--watch* is enable by default when you run *ng serve* so that any change in code is immidiately compiled and reflected in the browser.
But if in case, this is not happening in the 'Remote container' linux environent then work around is to run as below.

`ng serve --poll=2000`

If you run into Ivy related issues when trying to use material component, then update package.json as below to fix the issue.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "ngcc"
  }
}
```

Run `npm install` after updating *package.json*

Next,

Add a new components 'home', 'about-us' and 'contact-us' using below command

`ng g c home`

`ng g c about-us`

`ng g c contact-us`

Add routes as below to app module

```
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'about-us', component: AboutUsComponent},
  { path: 'contact-us', component: ContactUsComponent},
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent},
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full'}
];
```

Update imports section by adding RouterModule as below

```
imports: [
    ...
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes),
    ...
  ],
```

Add guest module for non-authenticated users of the site.

`ng g m guest --routing=true`

Add a new component in guest module 

`ng g c guest/guest`

`ng g c guest/guest-home`

`ng g c guest/guest-header`

`ng g c guest/guest-footer`

`ng g c guest/guest-login`

Add `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` to *guest.component.html*

Update *guest-routing.module.ts* code as below

```
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { GuestHomeComponent } from './guest-home/guest-home.component';
import { GuestComponent } from './guest/guest.component';
import { LoginComponent } from './login/login.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'guest', component: GuestComponent, children: [
    { path: 'login', component: LoginComponent},
    { path: 'home', component: GuestHomeComponent},
    { path: '', redirectTo: '/guest/home', pathMatch: 'full'}
  ]}
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class GuestRoutingModule { }

```

Update *guest.component.html* as below

```
<app-guest-header></app-guest-header>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<app-guest-footer></app-guest-footer>

```
