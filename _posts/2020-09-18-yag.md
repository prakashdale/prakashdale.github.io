At first, create a new project being an empty web application simply called YAG using command:

```dotnet new web -n YAG```

Next, install the Microsoft.ReverseProxy package (at the time of that writing itâ€™s still in preview mode):


```dotnet add package Microsoft.ReverseProxy --version 1.0.0-preview.4.20424.2.```
